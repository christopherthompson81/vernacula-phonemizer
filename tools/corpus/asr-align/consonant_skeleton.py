Compare our IPA to the recognizer on the CONSONANT SKELETON ONLY.

⚠ THE REASON THIS SHOULD WORK BETTER THAN THE FULL DISTANCE. Run 43 profiled the phone-level
disagreements across all 28 languages, and *every* top substitution in *every* language was vowel
quality: `i→ɪ`, `a→ə`, `u→ʊ`, `ɛ→e`, `ɔ→o`. That is not error, it is two conventions disagreeing about
vowels by design — the recognizer has its own inventory and its own reduction habits. Those
disagreements are the bulk of the measured distance, so they are the NOISE FLOOR that hid everything
smaller. Run 41 hit that floor directly: a 2-phone edit inside a 120-phone utterance could not be
resolved at all.

Consonants are the opposite. Both sides agree on them far more closely, and a consonant that is
missing, extra, or wrong is much more likely to be OUR defect than a convention difference. Dropping
the vowels should therefore raise the signal and lower the floor at the same time.

⚠ WHAT COUNTS AS A CONSONANT IS A JUDGEMENT, AND IT IS TUNED HERE, NOT ASSUMED. Three classes are
excluded beyond the plain vowels:

  · GLIDES `j w ɥ` — they alternate with vowels across conventions (`j→ɪ` is a top-ten pair in th and
    pt), so keeping them reintroduces exactly the noise this is removing. Measured: including them
    drops the validation ratio from 4.6:1 to 3.1:1.
  · RHOTIC VOWELS `ɚ ɝ` — vowels that carry rhoticity; English readers vary (Run 43), so they are
    reader variation rather than defect.

⚠ `h` AND `ʔ` ARE KEPT, and excluding them was my first mistake here. The reasoning for dropping them
was sound in the abstract — the recognizer does insert and drop both freely — but the single largest
defect this corpus ever had was Kazakh ⟨ь⟩/⟨ъ⟩ emitting a GLOTTAL STOP in 408 rows. Excluding ʔ threw
away the evidence for the biggest fix, and the validation says so plainly: 1.8:1 without them against
4.6:1 with. It also produced ties rather than disagreements, which is worse than a wrong answer
because it looks like agreement. `--drop-weak` re-runs the losing variant so the claim stays checkable.

VALIDATION, because a new metric that has never been shown to detect anything is not evidence:
`--validate` scores the metric against the corpus's OWN known defects. The DB keeps the pre-fix IPA
in `ipa_prev`, and the seven merged fixes were mostly CONSONANT defects (fula ⟨sh⟩→ʃ, hausa ⟨ch⟩,
kazakh ʔ, hindi d͡ʒɲ→ɡj). A useful skeleton metric must separate old from new MORE sharply than the
full distance did. Measured on 2,314 such rows: full distance 3.5:1, this metric **4.6:1**.

# ⚠ THE RECOGNIZER'S INVENTORY IS COARSER THAN OURS, AND NOT BY A LITTLE.
# `facebook/wav2vec2-xlsr-53-espeak-cv-ft` is trained on espeak-generated labels, and espeak's phone set
# has no retroflex stops, no implosives and no clicks. Measured over all 176,526 aligned utterances it
# emits ZERO ʈ ɖ ɳ ɽ ʋ ɦ ɓ ɗ ʄ ǀ ǁ ǃ, while we emit 136,105 ʋ and 64,953 ʈ. Comparing those positions
# raw charges us for a distinction the instrument cannot make — and it lands hardest on exactly the
# languages that are in the corpus to PROVIDE those primitives (Fula's implosives, Nguni's clicks, the
# Indic retroflexes).
#
# So fold our side to the recognizer's resolution before comparing. This is NOT dropping the segment:
# a retroflex heard as [t] still tells us a consonant is THERE, and dropping it would lose the
# position too. The map is EMPIRICAL — for each phone the recognizer lacks, what it actually writes
# where we write that phone, measured by alignment over 40k utterances:
#
#     ɫ→l 84%   ʑ→ʒ 79%   χ→x 67%   ɸ→f 66%   ɓ→b 64%   ʏ→y 60%   ɖ→d 55%   ɦ→h 53%   ʋ→v 48%
#
# ⚠ The retroflexes are mostly DROPPED rather than substituted (ʈ 78%, ɳ 66%, ɽ 49%), which is itself
# the finding: the recognizer does not coarsen them, it loses them. They are still mapped to their
# plain counterpart, because when it does write something that is what it writes.

# defining it here and importing it back created a circular import the moment the report needed it.
# Re-exported under the original name so this module's own callers are unaffected.
