/**
 * Restore the CASING that FLEURS' normalization destroyed, so the phonemizer's initialism pass can see it.
 *
 * `core/initialisms.ts` matches `\p{Lu}{2,}` — capitals are the signal that a letter run is spelled out
 * rather than read as a word — and FLEURS lowercases every transcript. So `pbs`, `rspca`, `xdr` and `wned`
 * never entered the pass and reached the OOV g2p, which read them as words: `ɹspkˈɑː`, `wnˈɛd`,
 * unpronounceable onsets both. Run 33's wav2vec2 probe confirmed against the AUDIO that readers say letter
 * names here (`acma` → "A-C-M-A", `rspca` → "ar-es-pee-see-ay").
 *
 * We repair the INPUT rather than widen that matcher, because the matcher is shared by ~190 engines (it is
 * what reads French TGV and Russian США) and loosening it is a fleet-wide change. Fixing the corpus text
 * lets the existing, well-tested pass fire by itself, per language, with each language's own letter names.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS LIST IS HAND-REVIEWED AND MUST STAY THAT WAY. A phonotactic test cannot generate it, in both
 * directions at once:
 *
 *   - It OVER-selects. `isUnreadableEnglish` is an ENGLISH test, and every language's native vocabulary is
 *     full of clusters English does not license — Welsh `mewn`/`roedd`, German `nicht`, Czech `jsou`, Irish
 *     `bhfuil`, Vietnamese `khi`, Xhosa `kwaye`. Those are ordinary words their own engine reads correctly.
 *     2,164 candidate runs came out of the scan; ~46 survived cross-language filtering; 29 survived review.
 *   - It UNDER-selects, and `core/initialisms.ts` says so itself: "readability is not convention". `us`,
 *     `uk`, `ong`, `pib` are perfectly pronounceable and still spelled out.
 *
 * The discriminator that actually works is CROSS-LANGUAGE SPREAD: an international abbreviation shows up as
 * a Latin run in twenty-odd different corpora, a native word shows up in one. Everything below appears in
 * ≥4 languages (most in 20+) and was then checked by hand in context — see scan_initialism_candidates.mts
 * for the worklist that produced it, and `EXCLUDED` for what was rejected and why.
