"""
Add and maintain the review columns on the alignment table: `status` and `comment`.

The scoring pass produces a ranking; this produces a RECORD. The difference matters because the ranking
is recomputed every time the scorer changes — and it changed three times already, when modifier letters,
tone digits and recognizer failures each turned out to be scoring artefacts rather than defects. A verdict
written into the row survives that; a position in a sorted file does not.

Status values, and the split they encode:

  verified          the three views agree: input text, our IPA, and the recognized phones. Inside the
                    language's own distribution, so there is nothing here to look at. Set in bulk.
  investigate       in the tail for its language — a real disagreement worth a human read. Set in bulk.
  recognizer_short  the recognizer returned far too little to compare (a whole Welsh sentence came back
                    as the single phone `k`). Says nothing about our IPA. Set in bulk.
  defective_audio   the AUDIO is broken, not the IPA: far too short for its text. 585 Welsh files (17.1%
                    of that corpus) hold ~1.5 s for a sentence needing ~96 phones. Verified against the
                    source tar — the members really are that small there, so it is upstream FLEURS data
                    and not our download. NOT OURS TO FIX; the action is to exclude the pair from training
                    and report it upstream. Set in bulk.
  ---- below here are set by hand, and only ever by hand ----
  defect            our phonemization is wrong. The thing we are hunting.
  reader_divergence the reader did not say what the transcript says (Run 31's finding). Not ours to fix,
                    but it makes the PAIR bad training data, which is its own decision.
  convention        we and the recognizer disagree about notation, not about the reading (ʈ vs t, b vs v).
  artefact          the recognizer is simply wrong here.

⚠ A BULK PASS NEVER OVERWRITES A HAND VERDICT. Re-running the scorer must not silently erase review work,
so the automatic statuses are only written where `status` is NULL or is itself automatic.

Usage:
  python3 asr_align_label.py --apply                  # (re)apply the automatic labels
  python3 asr_align_label.py --set defect --lang en_us --id 28 --comment "adjacent numbers merged"
  python3 asr_align_label.py --stats
