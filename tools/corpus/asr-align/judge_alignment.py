"""
Read EVERY alignment row with a local model, rather than only the rows a distance heuristic flagged.

Why this is worth the compute rather than a refinement of the scorer:

  · A DISTANCE CANNOT SEE A CLOSE-BUT-WRONG ROW. `2008 400` read as *two million eight thousand four
    hundred* scores well — it is fluent, correctly-stressed English of about the right length. It was
    caught only because a human read it. Every defect of that shape is invisible to 3xMAD by construction.
  · THE HEURISTIC ITSELF WAS WRONG THREE TIMES in this run — modifier letters, tone digits, and recognizer
    failures each produced a whole language of false or missing flags. A second, independent reader is
    worth having precisely because the first one is a metric I wrote.
  · THE BULK IS THE POINT. 74k rows currently say "verified" on the strength of a median. That claim is
    what the training set rests on, and nothing has actually looked at it.

⚠ THE MODEL TRIAGES, IT DOES NOT DECIDE. Its verdicts land in `judge_verdict` / `judge_note`, beside — not
on top of — the `status` column, so a hand verdict and a heuristic verdict and a model verdict can
disagree visibly. Disagreement between the three is itself the most interesting thing this produces.

⚠ AND IT IS NOT ASKED WHETHER THE IPA IS "CORRECT". It cannot know that. It is asked the one question the
three columns can actually settle: do the transcript, our IPA, and the phones the recognizer heard tell
the same story, and if not, which one is the odd one out.

Rows already labelled `defective_audio` or `recognizer_short` are skipped — their audio side is known
broken, so there is nothing for a reader to adjudicate.

Usage:
  python3 judge_alignment.py --probe 200        # timed sample, prints an ETA and stops
  python3 judge_alignment.py --batch 10
  python3 judge_alignment.py --langs en_us fr_fr

SYSTEM = """For each item, answer TWO questions in order. They are separate; do not let one answer the other.

T = the sentence the reader was given.  I = our phonemization of T.  H = phones a recognizer
(wav2vec2-xlsr-53, espeak-flavoured) got from the audio, run together, no separators.

QUESTION 1 — IS I A CORRECT READING OF T?  Ignore H completely. Read T, work out what it should sound
like, compare with I. Check every one of these, because this is where we know defects live:

  · numbers        each number read separately? two adjacent numbers must NOT merge into one bigger one
  · years / dates  read the way THIS language reads them. A DAY-OF-MONTH before or after a month name is
                   an ORDINAL in German, French, Welsh, Turkish, Catalan, Portuguese and Tamil (German
                   `24 september` must be *vierundzwanzigsTEN*, not the cardinal). English is the odd one
                   out in using a cardinal there.
  · abbreviations  expanded to the word (Dr., St., etc., bzw., f.Kr.) rather than spelled as a cluster
  · acronyms       letter runs said as letter NAMES, not read as a word (u.s. must not be the word "us").
                   A short letter run that is not a word of the language is an acronym even when it looks
                   pronounceable: es/pt `irm` (MRI) is "i-ere-eme", not the word *ˈiɾm*; cs `rs`, sv `bnp`,
                   fr `pdg` likewise. If I renders such a run as a single syllable, that is ipa_suspect.
  · units          km/kg/mm expanded to the unit word
  · symbols        % ° $ £ spoken
  · anything in T with no counterpart in I at all, or vice versa

If any of those is wrong -> ipa_suspect, and name it. A defect here is usually FLUENT: `2008 400` read as
"two million eight thousand four hundred" is well-formed speech and still wrong. Do not be reassured by I
looking plausible on its own.

QUESTION 2 — DOES H SHOW THE SAME UTTERANCE AS I?  H is a different, lossy notation. These are measured
correspondences on rows that DO match, so every one of them is agreement, not difference:

  rhotics all collapse   ʁ ɹ ɾ r are one thing; German ɐ̯ also returns as ɾ
  spirantisation         d->ð  s->θ  b->β   (it over-produces ð θ β)
  vowel quality is FREE  ɔ~o  e~ɛ  a~ɑ  ə~ɪ~ɐ  i~ɪ  — never judge on vowel identity
  ɫ->l  t͡ʃ->tʃ  d͡ʒ->dʒ  eᶦ->eɪ  oᶷ->oʊ ; it inserts ɪ ʊ freely and drops t d s ə

H NEVER contains stress, length, tie bars, or modifier letters (ʰ ˠ ʲ ʷ) — absence proves nothing. Tone is
a trailing DIGIT (siɛ5). H runs 5-10% shorter than I on every utterance, EVENLY, not at the end. On
unintelligible audio it emits plausible English-ish phones rather than going quiet.

  reader_diverged  a word you can NAME is in one and not the other. Never from length, never from failing
                   to align the tail.
  notation_only    differences are only the conventions above AND question 1 was clean.
  unclear          H too garbled to judge.
  agree            question 1 clean and H shows the same utterance.

⚠ DO NOT IMPORT ENGLISH CONVENTIONS into question 1. Most languages read a year as a plain cardinal —
Amharic 1981 as "thousand nine hundred eighty one" is CORRECT; so are Chinese, Tamil, Hindi and Arabic
year readings. English's year-pair reading is the exception. Judge against THIS language.

Verdict priority: ipa_suspect > reader_diverged > unclear > notation_only > agree.
Note under 12 words, only when not agree. One entry per item, using its id."""

    # enlarging the batch moved 0.76 -> 0.73 s/row (nothing), because the cost is prompt processing at
    # ~401 tok/row. Where that goes: TEXT 137, IPA 124, HEARD 118 tokens per row.
    #
    # The recognizer emits phones SPACE-SEPARATED (`t eː ʃ a w a`), and those spaces are pure overhead —
    # each costs about a token. Removing them takes HEARD from 118 to 59 tok/row, the single biggest
    # saving available, and it does not cost information the model was using: our own IPA has no phone
    # spaces either, so both sides are read as strings in the same shape.
