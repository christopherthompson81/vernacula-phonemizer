"""
Aggregate the PHONE-LEVEL disagreements between our IPA and the recognizer, per language.

⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS. Reading the investigate queue row by row found every large defect class in this
corpus — but it is a per-row instrument, and a defect that is spread thinly across many rows looks
like noise in each one. A single wrong mapping that costs one phone per utterance never makes the
worst-first queue at all, because one phone in a hundred does not move the distance.

So: align our IPA against the recognizer's phones for the rows already flagged, and count the
SUBSTITUTIONS. A systematic error shows up as one pair dominating the tally; recognizer noise shows
up as a long flat tail of unrelated pairs.

⚠ AND MOST OF WHAT IT REPORTS IS *EXPECTED*. The recognizer has its own inventory and its own
conventions: rhotics collapse, aspiration is unmarked, our tie bars and length marks have no
counterpart. The `fold()` shared with asr_align_report.py removes the worst of that, but plenty
remains, so the output is a RANKING to read, never a defect list. The question to ask of the top
pair is not "is this a mismatch" — it is "is this mismatch one the recognizer would make anyway?"
