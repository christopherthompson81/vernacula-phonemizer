/**
 * THE DEFECT CLASSES, in one place (#586) — what counts as a leak, what counts as a drop, and the
 * REDUNDANT-vs-DROP discrimination that separates a permissible drop from a real one.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. These tables lived in three copies — `mine.ts scan`, `corpus-diff.ts emit` and
 * `coverage.ts` — and they had DRIFTED. The union of the three is strictly better than any one of them:
 *
 *   class        mine.ts        corpus-diff.ts   coverage.ts
 *   minus        [-−–]          [-−] only        absent
 *   math-sign    yes            BLIND            BLIND
 *   exponent     BLIND          BLIND            yes
 *   ampersand    BLIND          BLIND            yes
 *   iteration    BLIND          BLIND            yes
 *   ZERO-WIDTH   yes            absent           absent
 *
 * Read the third row twice. `corpus-diff.ts` is the gate whose own header calls it "the verification gate
 * that caught more real defects than any other check", and it could not see a dropped `&` or a dropped `²`
 * — which are the exact two defects #586 opens with (English, the first language ever treated, drops both).
 * Every language reviewed against that gate was reviewed with those two classes switched off.
 *
 * The drift was invisible because it was three files agreeing on the concept and disagreeing on the data.
 * That is the argument for the extraction: the tables are a SHARED FACT about the fleet, not a per-tool
 * setting, and the ISO-code work in #601 had to be applied to two of the three copies by hand.

 * which is a CLI script and therefore cannot be imported — so `coverage.ts` could not sweep the fleet with the
 * same probes `review.ts` uses per language, and the #654 progress number had to be re-derived in a scratch
 * script each time. That is exactly the shape the `DROPPABLE` comment above warns about: this very list was
 * once missing `÷ > ±`, the exponent and the currency sign, and nothing said so.
 *
 * ⚠ IT CANNOT BE DERIVED FROM `DROPPABLE`. A defect regex is not a probe string, and one class needs several
 * probes — `math-sign` alone covers `+ ± = < > × ÷`. `review.ts` asserts the mapping between the two rather
 * than trusting it, which turns the next omission into a loud failure.
 *

 * This names a whole CLASS for a language: no reading of this sign is shippable here at all, so `review.ts`'s

 * ⚠ WHY IT EXISTS RATHER THAN JUST LETTING THE GATE FAIL. A hard fail that can never be fixed is noise, and
 * noise is how the audit's own hardcoded 37-of-67 list stayed wrong for months — a number nobody trusted

 * length in their own files, which meant the line said nothing about whether anything had REGRESSED.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS DELIBERATELY SHORT. Only a class whose refusal is ARGUED IN THE LANGUAGE'S OWN FILE belongs
 * here; "no rule yet" is a TODO and must keep failing. Every other language in the `minus` and `plus-minus`

 * DESIGNATIONS ACCEPTED AS CORRECTLY SILENT (#586) — the sweep's permanent residual, named per instance.
 *
 * WHY A BASELINE AND NOT A GUARD. The `minus` class above explains why a spaced designation cannot be
 * separated from a real negative by pattern: `चंद्रयान -1` and a real `-5 stupňů` are the same shape — word,
 * space, dash, digit — so telling them apart needs a LEXICON, and the comment there records the judgement that
 * "a quiet gate would be worse". That judgement still holds; widening the regex to swallow these would blind
 * the class to every true negative of the same shape, and hi's one real negative is exactly that shape.
 *
 * So these are accepted BY IDENTITY instead. Each entry is the literal designation string as it appears in the
 * corpus, and a hit is accepted only when EVERY occurrence of the symbol in that sentence falls inside one of
 * them. Two properties follow, and both are the point:
 *   · a SIXTH designation, or the same one in a new language, still reports — nothing is suppressed by shape
 *   · a sentence carrying a listed designation AND a real negative still reports, because the negative's match
 *     does not lie inside a named span
 *
 * WHAT IS BEING ASSERTED. Not that the drop is harmless — that the reading is already CORRECT. These are
 * product names (`Chandrayaan-1`) and bill numbers (`HJR-3`) whose hyphen is silent in speech, so a silent
 * hyphen is the right output and the differential test is reporting a true fact with a false label. Resolved
 * per hit across all 66 artifacts; see docs/investigations/sign_reading_investigation.md.
 *
 * The five are two universal sentences: FLEURS translates ONE English set, so `Chandrayaan-1` and `HJR-3` recur
 * across the fleet, and these five are simply the languages that write a SPACE before the hyphen. Every other
 * language writes it closed and the `(?<![\p{L}\p{M}\p{Nd}])` guard already handles it.
