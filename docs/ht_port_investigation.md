# ht (Haitian Creole) TypeScript → C# port — investigation log

Target: `csharp/Vernacula.Phonemizer/Languages/Haitian/` mirroring `src/languages/haitian/`
(738 lines: `haitian.ts` 117, `normalize.ts` 501, `numbers.ts` 109, `manifest.ts` 11).

## Run 1 — 2026-08-26, port + golden gate

Command: `dotnet run --project csharp/tools/parity -- ht`.
Question: does the straight port reproduce the 200 golden rows byte-for-byte?

Result: **200/200 OK, 0 differ, 0 BLOCKED**, first attempt. `Registry.cs` already carried `case "ht"`;
registration added to `Languages/Bootstrap.cs`; `HaitianManifestIsFullyMapped` and
`HaitianNumbersManifestIsFullyMapped` added to `ManifestMappingTests` (the jsonc is read by TWO
independent types, mirroring the TS module split, so each is asserted against the whole file with the
other's keys listed as metadata).

Implication: the golden is a MINED golden over 200 ht.wikipedia paragraphs. It exercises the g2p and the
common normalizer arms hard, but says nothing about the rare ones. Proceed to the differential.

## Run 2 — 2026-08-26, the intra-word apostrophe and hyphen (the brief's question)

Question: Haitian writes `l'ap`, `n'ap`, `ki-sa`, `pa-t`. Does the word arm stop at either mark, splitting
the word the way Swedish's did in #1073?

Measured, not assumed — over `tools/corpus/mined/ht.jsonc` + `tools/corpus/attest/ht.jsonc` + the 200
golden texts:

| mark | intra-word count | reading |
|---|---|---|
| U+0027 `'` | 73 mined + 46 in the golden texts | **one token** — `l'ap` → *lap*, `d'Alain` → *dalain*, `Louverture's` → *luveɣtuɣes* |
| `-` | 229 mined + 35 in the golden texts | **one token** — `ki-sa` → *kisa*, `pa-t` → *pat*, `politically-engaged` → *politikaljɛ̃ɡaɡed* |
| U+2019 `’` | 13 mined + 2 in the golden texts | **SPLIT** — `l’Hôpital` → *l hopital*, `d’Haïti` → *d haiti* |

So the answer is: the class the brief named IS live in ht, but on the TYPOGRAPHIC apostrophe only.
`hostWordRun(["Latin"], "'-")` never listed U+2019, while `core/clauses.ts`'s own `LATIN_RUN` and
`FOREIGN_RUN` both do, and ~20 sibling Latin engines list it beside U+0027 (kl, kea, qu, sn, so, lg, …).
One construction, two spellings, two readings — and the split leaves a **stranded [l] / [d] in front of
the noun**, which is the defect shape, not merely an inconsistency.

Instances read rather than counted: all 13 are elisions (`d’un`, `d’Amérique`, `d’informatique`, `qu’il`,
`l’innocence`, `d’Haïti`, `L’autoportrait`), and one of them is a Haitian PLACE NAME the corpus glosses
itself — `Mòn Lopital (Morne l’Hôpital)`.

⚠ **THE SECOND HALF OF THE SWEDISH FIX IS NOT NEEDED HERE, and that was checked rather than assumed.**
Swedish needed a `medialOnly`-plus-lookahead guard because its g2p passes an unread character through into
the IPA. `haitian.ts`'s `scan` has no fall-through: `const ph = G[c]; if (ph !== undefined && ph !== "")`
drops any character `graphemes` does not name. Probed both ways round — `’moun yo` → *mun jo* and
`moun’ yo` → *mun jo*, byte-identical to the U+0027 spellings, before and after the widening.

**Fixed, TypeScript first (`src/languages/haitian/haitian.ts`), then goldens, then C#:**

    hostWordRun(["Latin"], "'-")  →  hostWordRun(["Latin"], "'’-")
    NATIVE_CLASS "[a-zèòéàA-ZÈÒÉÀ'-]"  →  "[a-zèòéàA-ZÈÒÉÀ'’-]"

Before / after, on the golden's own two rows:

    d’Haïti          d haiti          →  dhaiti
    L’autoportrait   l autopoɣtɣait   →  lautopoɣtɣait

**2 golden rows moved** (rows 9 and 182), both this shape. Pinned in `test/haitian.test.ts` (the ASCII and
typographic spellings must produce IDENTICAL output) and in `csharp/…Tests/HaitianTests.cs`.

## Run 3 — 2026-08-26, the differential

There is **no FLEURS for Haitian Creole**, so widening (1) of PORTING.md is unavailable and the weight
falls on the mined artifacts plus hand probes.

* 571 unique lines from `tools/corpus/mined/ht.jsonc` + `tools/corpus/attest/ht.jsonc`
* 265 adversarial probes — one per `normalize.ts` arm plus the neighbour each arm must decline, every
  number band the LSP table names, and the g2p corners (nasal contexts, `Vnn`, digraphs, ⟨r⟩→[w],
  degemination, both apostrophes, the hyphen, an astral character, a LONE SURROGATE, combining marks)
* 102 further probes for the accented forms the first set missed (`20yèm`, `km/èdtan`, `°C`) and the
  crash corners (empty string, bare `$`/`%`/`°`, `9007199254740993yèm`, 24-digit runs)

938 lines, **sync and async, both engines: 0 differ**, before and after the U+2019 fix.

⚠ **What fraction of the corpus reaches the new code:** all 571 lines run the g2p and the clause
assembler; 13 lines carry the U+2019 the fix is about; 0 lines carry an astral code point outside the two
that route to a Han engine, so the lone-surrogate and astral probes are synthetic (no crash in .NET —
`scan` indexes UTF-16 code units exactly as the JS does, and the unmapped half is dropped rather than
handed to `Normalize`).

## Run 4 — 2026-08-26, reading for defects the gate cannot see

Both engines agree byte-for-byte on every item below, so no gate could ever fire on one. See STATUS.md
for the summary; the measurements are here.

### A decimal glued to a letter reads its separator as a CLAUSE BREAK — ×8 attested, NOT FIXED

`normalize.ts` step 10's trailing guard is `(?![\d\p{L}\p{M}])`, documented as keeping "a dotted
designation (`802.11a`) out". Declining is not neutral: the `.` or `,` survives to the tokenizer, whose
punctuation arm turns it into a full stop or a comma pause. One number becomes two utterances.

    17.09m.        →  disɛt . nɛf m .            (an athletics distance, mined)
    1.9pwen        →  ɛ̃ . nɛf pwɛ̃                (a basketball statistic, mined)
    442.7k disip   →  kat sã kaɣãnde . sɛt k     (a follower count, mined)
    8.5x11         →  ɥit . sɛ̃k ks ɔ̃z            (a page size, mined)
    802.11n        →  ɥit sã de . ɔ̃z n
    1 a 1,5m       →  ɛ̃ a ɛ̃ , sɛ̃k m              ← THE FILE'S OWN ATTESTATION for the `a` connective
    50cm a 1,80m   →  … a ɛ̃ , katɣevɛ̃ m          ← likewise

⚠ The last two are quoted verbatim in `normalize.ts` twice (step 5's span paragraph and RANGE's
connective paragraph) as the corpus evidence for rules the file DOES ship — and they misread.

Counted over mined + attest + the golden texts: `\d[.,]\d+[letter]` ×12. Two are already rescued by the
unit tier (`1.00mm`, `7.5cm` — `mm` and `cm` are declared keys), 3 are genuine quantities glued to a
non-key (`17.09m`, `1.9pwen`, `442.7k`), 5 are designations or URL residue (`8.5x11`, four
`doi:10.1075/…`). **The current reading is wrong for all 8** — the guard does not leave a designation
alone, it inserts a sentence boundary into it.

NOT FIXED: the repair is a designations-vs-quantities judgement. Reading the separator as `vigil` fixes
the 3 quantities and replaces a bogus full stop with a bogus *vigil* in the 5 designations; the third
option — keep declining but suppress the pause — needs a mechanism neither engine has. **0 golden rows
reach the shape**, so it is cheap to land once the call is made. Related and NOT independently fixable:
`m` is deliberately excluded from `UNITS` (the file's own `107 m jou lane` counter-example), so `17.09m`
cannot be rescued the way `7.5cm` is.

### A NON-ASCENDING span drops its unit entirely — ×0 attested, NOT FIXED

Step 5's single-operand arm carries `(?<!\d\s?[-–—]\s?)`, so it declines the second operand of a dash
span. That guard is only ever REACHED when the span arm has already declined (when the span arm fires it
rewrites the dash away), and non-ascending pairs are exactly what the span arm declines:

    50-53 km  →  sɛ̃kãt a sɛ̃kãntwa kilomɛt      (ascending: the unit is read)
    53-50 km  →  sɛ̃kãntwa sɛ̃kãt km             (descending: the unit is GONE)

×0 in either artifact (`\d+\s?[-–—]\s?\d+\s?(?:km|cm|mm|kg)` descending). Unreachable today, live the
moment one appears — the `tl numberStressIdx` shape, filed for the same reason.

### The `-eyen` ordinal band strands a bare *jɛm* — the very defect step 12 exists to fix

`ordinalWord` declines when no tail matches, which is the documented behaviour for the `-en` band, but the
raw suffix then reads as its own word:

    20yèm  →  vɛ̃tjɛm            (claimed)
    21yèm  →  vɛ̃tejɛ̃ jɛm        (declined — *ven* plus a separate *jɛm*, step 12's own before-picture)
    81yèm  →  katɣevenɛ̃ jɛm
    101yèm →  sã ɛ̃ jɛm
    0yèm   →  zewo jɛm
    1000000yèm → ɛ̃ miljɔ̃ jɛm

NOT FIXED: `venteyen` + `yèm` is unsourced, and `ordinalTails` is a sourced table. Needs a Haitian
ordinal for the `-eyen` decade band. All 22 `ordinalTails` rows ARE reached (checked by composing every
band); this is the gap between them.

### Smaller, all pre-existing and all shared shapes

* `2 − 2 fè zewo` → *de de* — U+2212 in SPACED arithmetic is silent (step 4b claims the LEADING sign only,
  deliberately). An operator dropped, not mis-read.
* `20 °Cx` → *vɛ̃ kks* and `(0) c°` → *zewo k* — the degree sign vanishes when a letter follows or when the
  number is not adjacent. Identical to the `lo` finding already filed in STATUS.md.
* `ISBN`, `US`, `X` read as Haitian WORDS (*isbn*, *us*, *ks*) because ht has no `letterName` table —
  espeak ships no Haitian Creole. The fleet-wide sourcing block `normalize.ts` already records.

### Hygiene, no output change

`normalize.ts` step 1's zero-width class was written
with the four characters written literally, so the line reads as an empty class. Escaped to `/[\u200b\u200c\u200d\ufeff]/` in both
engines — the #931 rule. Verified byte-identical over all 938 differential lines afterwards.
