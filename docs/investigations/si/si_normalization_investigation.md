# si (Sinhala) text normalization — investigation log

Corpus artifact: `tools/corpus/mined/si.jsonc` — si.wikipedia dump, **191,335 paragraphs**, 448 mined
segments (248 hard + 200 sample), `covered 31/35`, `cellsTotal 35` (current, not stale). No FLEURS corpus
for Sinhala, so the artifact IS the corpus and its `counts` are DUMP-WIDE frequencies.

Referee: wikipron `sin_sinh_narrow` (human), 648 words. **No second source wired** (eval prints a
`secondary-source gap` warning; epitran `sin` would corroborate).

## Run 1 — 2026-08-11 — baseline: what the engine does to attested forms

Command: `npx tsx tools/normalization/{mine.ts scan,sources.ts,review.ts}` + a hand probe through
`phonemize(s, "si")`.

`mine.ts scan` (448 lines):

```
DROP percent   ×31   DROP math-sign ×22   DROP currency ×16   DROP degree ×10
DROP minus     ×8    DROP exponent  ×6    DROP ampersand ×3    FOREIGN ampersand ×3
```

`review.ts`: `[FAIL] normalizer missing` — nothing else runs until the file exists.
`sources.ts`: espeak does **not ship Sinhala at all**, so letter-names and the decimal point report
`[NONE]` from the espeak side; percent/currency/minus/equals/times/ampersand/exponent all `[chk?]`.

Hand probe of the current engine (the defect list this layer exists to fix):

| input | reading | what is wrong |
|---|---|---|
| `12.5` | `d̪ˈoləhə . pˈahə` | the decimal point is a CLAUSE PAUSE — "twelve. five" |
| `2,400` | `d̪ˈekə , hˈat̪ərə sˈijəjə` | the grouping comma is a clause comma — "two, four hundred" |
| `1,001,450` | `ˈekə , ˈekə , hˈat̪ərə sˈijəjə pˈanəhə` | three numbers and two pauses |
| `70%` | `hˈæt̪ːæːw` | `%` dropped |
| `12:30` | `d̪ˈoləhə , t̪ˈihə` | the clock colon is a comma |
| `20°C` | `ʋˈisːə sˈiː` | degree dropped, `C` read as the ENGLISH letter name |
| `$5` | `pˈahə` | sign dropped |
| `120 km/h` | `sˈijəjə ʋˈisːə ˈʊkm ˈeᶦt͡ʃ` | trap 47 exactly — raw `km` + the English letter H |
| `50 km²` | `pˈanəhə ˈʊkm skwˈɛɹd` | and the English word *squared* |
| `10¹⁵` | `d̪ˈahəjə` | the whole exponent vanishes |
| `Y = 0.25` | `wˈaᶦ bˈind̪uw . ʋˈisipˌəhə` | `=` dropped; `0.25` → "zero. twenty-five" |

Baseline referee: **606/648 (93.5%) folded backbone**, symbol accuracy 98.3%.

**Implication.** Every one of these is in this layer except the last column of row 8/9 (`km`), which is a
missing tier declaration. Write the layer.

## Run 2 — 2026-08-11 — the biggest defect is not in any cell: ZWJ splits every conjunct

Question: the `zero-width` cell counts **144,214** occurrences — the largest count in the artifact by a
factor of two over `digit-run`. Is that noise, or is it load-bearing?

Census over the 448 mined segments: **ZWJ (U+200D) ×1,978, ZWNJ (U+200C) ×258, ZWSP (U+200B) ×22**. Of
the 1,978 ZWJ, **1,841 immediately follow a virama ්** — i.e. they are the ordinary Sinhala conjunct
(rakaransaya `්‍ර`, yansaya `්‍ය`, repaya `ර්‍`), not stray markup.

`sinhala.ts`'s word token is `[඀-෿]+`, and **U+200D is outside that range**, so every conjunct is two
tokens:

```
ක්‍රි      → k rˈi        (should be krˈi)
ශ්‍රී      → s rˈiː       ← the country's own name
ප්‍රතිශතය  → p rˈat̪isˌət̪əjə
මිශ්‍ර     → mˈis rˈə
```

With the joiner removed the same words read correctly (`ක්රි → krˈi`, `ප්රතිශතය → prˈat̪isˌət̪əjə`), because
in Sinhala **ZWJ only selects the ligature glyph — it never reorders the letters**, so stripping it is
phonemically lossless and re-joins the token.

**Implication.** This is the single highest-traffic defect in the language and it is a pre-tokenizer
text→text rewrite, which is exactly what this layer is. It is *not* in any defect class the scan hunts:
the leak classes look for a surviving digit/mark and the DROP test looks for a symbol that says nothing —
a ZWJ says nothing *and should say nothing*. What it does is split a word, and no gate in the tree looks
for that.

---

## Run 3 — 2026-08-11 — the word order: Sinhala puts the measure BEFORE the number

Question: the shared symbol tier can only postpose a unit/currency word (trap 47, case 2). Which side does
Sinhala write?

Corpus (`w.ts` window-grep over the 448 segments) — every attested instance is measure-first:

```
වර්ග කිලෝමීටර් 1,001,450   (වර්ග සැතපුම් 386,660)      මිලිමීටර් 2,400 ක්
කිලෝමීටර් 7,517ක            සෙන්ටිමීටර් 50ක (අඟල් 8)     කිලෝග්‍රෑම් 300 (රාත්තල් 650)
ග්‍රෑම් 75                   මීටර් 400                   ඝන සෙන්ටිමීටර 200 ක් (200 cm3 / 200 cc)
```

and the same for the percent word, which is `සියයට` — **4/4 in the corpus and 4/4 on the wiki probe, all
prefix**:

```
සියයට 4.8 ක    සියයට 88කට    සියයට 95 කට    සියයට 7 ක්
wiki: සියයට 50.6 සිට 49.4 දක්වා · සියයට 16.5 කින් · සියයට 65ක් · සියයට 12.1ක්
```

⚠ **`ප්‍රතිශතය` ×11 is NOT the percent word** — it is the abstract noun *proportion*, and the corpus proves
it by writing both at once: `88.8% ක ප්‍රතිශතයක්`, `49.2% ක ප්‍රතිශතයක්` ("a proportion of 88.8%"). Picking
by raw count would have picked the loser. Trap 37.

Currency, from `attest.ts --lang si`: `ඩොලර්` and `රුපියල්`, also prefix and also in a monetary slot —
`ඩොලර් 38,100ක්`, `රුපියල් මිලියන 50 ක`, and the corpus supplies the abbreviation itself:
*"රුපියල යන්න කෙටියෙන් දක්වන්නේ රු. (Rs)"* — "the rupee is abbreviated රු. (Rs)".

`දශම` is attested as the decimal point in a definitional sentence — *"… හෝ දශම තිතකින් ඇරඹී …"*, "…or
beginning with a decimal point" — plus `දශම වර්ගීකරණය` (Dewey **Decimal** Classification) and
`දශම රූපාකාරයෙන්` ("in decimal form").

**Implication.** The tier already has all three switches — `percentPrefix`, `currencyPrefix` and
`unitPrefix` (the Swahili case) — so none of that has to be local, which was the first guess and was wrong.
What IS local is the RATE: `පැයට කිලෝමීටර 250` puts a DATIVE-suffixed denominator at the head of the phrase,
and `unitPer` is one invariant string between two nouns. Trap 47 case 1, not case 2.

---

## Run 4 — 2026-08-11 — the layer, and what the gates said

Rules written, in order: joiners+`&nbsp;` → dotted abbreviations (closed list) → Sinhala-letter initials →
thousands de-grouping → degrees → negative → rate → the shared tier → the decimal point → re-strip.

```
npx vitest run                                        233 files, 3,360 tests
npx tsc --noEmit                                      OK
npx tsx tools/normalization/mine.ts scan --lang si    no defects   (was 8 classes, 96 hits)
npx tsx tools/normalization/review.ts --lang si       checklist clean
corpus-diff compare                                   changed 381/447 (85.2%), DROP 85 → 33
npx tsx tools/referee-eval/eval.ts si                 606/648 → 607/648
```

**The referee barely moves, and that is the expected result rather than a disappointment.** `eval.ts`
phonemizes si through `phonemizeWord`, which is the WORD path; the joiner defect is a TOKENIZER defect and
lives on the text path. Checked directly: the referee list carries 25 ZWJ-bearing words and
`phonemizeWord("අවුරුද්‍ද")` was already correct, because the abugida g2p skips the joiner — only the
tokenizer split on it. So the corpus diff is the instrument that can see this change and the referee is not.

### Three things the run found that the plan did not

**1. The measure word leads, so `mg` had to be withdrawn after being declared.** `mg` is ×9 in the mined
segments — a healthy count — and **all nine are inside a rate** (`126 mg/dl` ×4, `14.6 mg• L⁻¹` ×2,
`1.9mg/cm3`) whose denominator has no sourced Sinhala reading. With the key declared, `unitPrefix` moved the
number in front of a denominator the tier could not claim: `126 mg/dl` → *මිලිග්‍රෑම් 126/dl*. Trap 46's
"withdraw the key where it buys nothing", found by reading the reading rather than the count.

**2. `NOT_VERSION` costs eight metre readings and saves two.** Bare `m` is ×12 digit-adjacent: 10 metres, 2
the English million-suffix (`SDR69.5m (US$100m)`). The tier's version guard rejects a one-letter key glued to
a dotted number — which is both of the millions AND eight of the ten metres (`2.5m දිගින්`, `1.397m හා
0.508m`, `3.29m`, `9.75m`, `2.5m X 2.5m`). So both sides are paid for locally: the currency-glued `m` becomes
`මිලියන` before the tier, and the dotted-number-glued `m` becomes `මීටර්`, guarded on there being no Latin
letter before the number — which is exactly what separates `SDR69.5m` from `2.5m`.

**3. The rate rule must move the NUMBER, and must claim a whole RANGE.** Rewriting only the unit left
`120 km/h` as *120 පැයට කිලෝමීටර්* — operands in the wrong order, and unrepairable by the tier afterwards
because the unit is no longer number-adjacent. Capturing a single operand then produced
*35-පැයට කිලෝමීටර් 40*, tearing a range in half. Both are trap 14's fix shape.

### The measured refusals

| class | count | why not |
|---|---:|---|
| ranges | 6,900 (dump) | Sinhala writes its own connective — `9.1–9.3 අතර`, `115 –135 අතර`, `60°-75° අතර` — so a `සිට…දක්වා` rewrite says it twice. The dash's other mined uses are a date, a page range, a score, a season and a song title. |
| clock `NN:NN` | 2,921 (dump) | mostly NOT a clock: a Bible verse (`1 කොරි 15:14`), a citation (`1964:189/193/197`), against three timestamps inside one astronomy worked example. Sinhala also writes the time with a PERIOD (`8.30 AM`), character-identical to a decimal. |
| `=` | 700 (dump) | every mined instance is a glossary/table separator or a definition heading (`මාමා = මාමා`, `|alt=`); the two flanking a number are variable assignments. |
| `×` | — | all six mined are a DIMENSION CROSS after `මිලිමීටර්` (`8.2×6.3×0.6`), which is "by", not "times"; `ගුණිත` ×0. |
| fractions | 1,078 (dump) | diluted the same way `abbrev` is — the mined `N/M` are a cricket score, a season, a date, an aperture and a shutter speed. Genuine ones are `1/4 කි`, `1/50 කි`, `¼ කි`. |
| `±` `<` `>` `÷` | ×0 each | no sign and no word. |

### The trap-2 instance of the run

`abbrev` is 29,394 in the dump and **that is mostly a sentence period with no space after it** —
`ය.කොරල්පර`, `වේ.තව`, `රටකි.විවිධ`. A shape rule would have read thousands of clause boundaries as
abbreviations. The initials rule therefore requires **two** dots in the run, measured at
**20 matches, zero false positives** over the 448 segments, and everything else is a closed list.

### Not a normalization defect, found on the way

`ං` before a SIBILANT fell to the ම් default, so `අක්ෂාංශ` read *ˈakʃaːmsə*. wikipron's one ං+sibilant word
refutes it — `පංසු = p ə ŋ s u` against the engine's *pˈamsu*. Fixed in `sinhala.jsonc` (a fourth anusvara
class), **606/648 → 607/648**, no word lost. It mattered here rather than later because the degree rule now
emits `අංශක` for every `°`, so the gap would have been *introduced* into a high-traffic reading instead of
merely inherited.

**Still open, and out of this layer:** ශ/ෂ/ස all read `s` where the referee has `ʃ` (`බංගලාදේශය`). That is a
phoneme-inventory decision, and `eval.ts` prints a standing `secondary-source gap` warning for si — epitran
`sin` would be the second opinion it needs.

---

## Run 5 — 2026-08-11 — the review pass: probe the adversarial neighbour of every rule

Trap 8 says a rule is correct exactly where you looked. Thirty-three probes, of which three found a defect:

| probe | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `ස්කන්ධයෙන් .9% ක්` | `…ස්කන්ධයෙන් . සියයට 9 ක්` — a spurious SENTENCE BREAK | `සියයට 0 දශම 9` |
| `90.20 K (−182.95 °C…)` | the kelvin dropped, the sentence half-read | `කෙල්වින් 90 දශම 2 0 (සෙල්සියස් අංශක ඍණ 182 දශම 9 5…)` |
| `ක්‍රි.ව.1940 දී` | `ක්‍රිස්තු වර්ෂ1940` — the expansion glued to its year | `ක්‍රිස්තු වර්ෂ 1940` |

**The truncated decimal is the interesting one, because the guard is the whole rule.** `.9%` writes `0.9%`
without its zero. There are 13 dot-before-digit hits in the mined segments and **only that one is a
decimal**: the other twelve are the corpus's missing-space-after-a-full-stop (`ඇත.2011`, `තිබේ.1930`,
`ය.1958`) plus the abbreviation `අවු.18`, and every one of those is GLUED to a letter while the decimal is
preceded by a SPACE. So the rule is `(?<=[\s(\[])\.(?=\p{Nd})` → `0.` and the twelve stay pauses. Had it
been written on the shape instead, it would have deleted twelve sentence boundaries.

**Kelvin needed sourcing before it could be read, and takes no degree word.** `කෙල්වින්` ×37 whole-word on
si.wikipedia, in the right sense — *කෙල්වින් යනු උෂ්නත්වය මිනුමකි* ("Kelvin is a temperature measure") and
*කෙල්වින් මගින් ඇති ද්‍රවාංකයයි* (a melting point stated in kelvin). Digit-adjacent `K` is ×2 and both are
kelvin. But a bare one-letter uppercase key is the trap-46 shape, so it is claimed only SPACE-SEPARATED and
not before a dot: `5K` (a designation) and `1990 K.M.` (an initial) both stay unread. The two corpus
instances are the *same sentences* the °C/°F rule already handles, so this finishes them.

**What the probes confirmed rather than changed**, worth recording so nobody re-tests it: `%25` prefix sign,
`5$` sign-after, `₨500`, `98.6°f` lowercase, `50 m2`/`50 m3` ASCII exponents, `B&B`, `-5` and `(-5)`,
`425KM` uppercase, ZWNJ conjuncts — all already correct. And the three refusals held: `1,0000` and `1,00`
are not de-grouped, `ලකුණු 156ක්, තරග 90කදී` keeps its clause comma, `ප%තිපත්ති` keeps its manufactured `%`
silent.

Gates after: 3,363 tests, tsc OK, scan "no defects", review.ts clean, corpus diff 381/447 with DROP 85 → 33,
referee 607/648.

---

## Run 6 — 2026-08-11 — the review's real find: an abbreviation key that eats a sentence boundary

Question asked while re-reading the diff rather than the probes: **the corpus's commonest dot is a full stop
with no space after it, and every one of my abbreviation keys ends in an ordinary Sinhala syllable. What
happens when they meet?**

```
ලංකාවේ නගරයකි.මීගමුව කොපන්   →  ලංකාවේ නගරයකිලෝමීටර් ගමුව කොපන්
මෙය හැකි.මීටර් 400            →  මෙය හැකිලෝමීටර් ටර් 400
තරු. 500 ක්                   →  තරුපියල් 500 ක්
ශක්‍රි.වචන                    →  ශක්රිස්තු වර්ෂ චන
```

**මීගමුව is a city and it is in this corpus** — it opens one of the mined segments. Two clause breaks
destroyed and four words corrupted, and **none of it appears in the 448 mined segments**: the artifact
samples 0.23% of the dump, so a shape that needs one particular collocation will not be in it. The corpus
diff was clean, the scan said "no defects", `review.ts` said checklist clean, and the bug was there.

Fixed by bounding every key on both sides (`(?<![඀-෿])` … `(?![඀-෿])`). One detail that had to be got right:
**the trailing space is emitted by the REPLACEMENT, not absorbed by the pattern** — a pattern ending in
`\s?` consumes the space and then the right guard looks at the letter beyond it, which rejects the perfectly
good `සෙ.මී. ඝන වානේ` on its ඝ.

**The lesson to carry, and it is not "add guards".** Every gate in this tree measures against the artifact,
and the artifact is a SAMPLE. Trap 8 says zero corpus instances is not evidence of correctness; this is the
same statement about a *sampled* corpus, and it bites hardest on rules keyed to a language's own script,
where the adversarial neighbour is an ordinary word rather than an exotic symbol. The probe that found it
was constructed from two facts already written down in this file — "the commonest dot is a missing space"
and "`මී`-initial words exist" — not from any tool.

Gates after: 3,365 tests, tsc OK, scan "no defects", review.ts clean, corpus diff 381/447 unchanged with
DROP 85 → 33, referee 607/648.

---

## Run 7 — 2026-08-11 — the sibilants: the open question was mis-stated, and the sources settle it

The maturity row was left saying *"ශ/ෂ/ස all read `s` where the referee has `ʃ`"*. **Both halves of that are
wrong**, and a web search plus one measurement shows why.

**What the sources say.** [r12a's Sinhala script notes](https://r12a.github.io/scripts/sinh/si.html) map
ස (śuddha) → /s/ and **both** miśra letters ශ and ෂ → /ʃ/. [Wikipedia's Sinhala
phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhala_language) says /ʃ/ "is found in learned borrowings from
Sanskrit and English, including in the honorific ශ්‍රී (śrī)" and is "commonly … replaced by /s/". Popular
descriptions add that the three-way distinction is "often lost in modern spoken Sinhala", which is the
documented reason Sinhala spellers confuse these letters.

So there are exactly two coherent analyses — **literary** (ශ=ʃ, ෂ=ʃ) and **colloquial** (both s) — and they
agree on the one thing that matters here: **ශ and ෂ are the same sound as each other.** The engine shipped
`ශ→s` with `ෂ→ʃ`, which is neither.

**What the referee says**, read letter by letter rather than in aggregate:

```
ෂ  9 referee words, s in 9 of 9   ඖෂධය → a u s ə d ə j ə · පුරුෂ · විෂ්ණු · තෘෂ්ණාව · වේෂ්ටය …
ශ  9 referee words, s in 6 of 9   ශ්‍රී → s r iː  ← the word Wikipedia cites as THE example of /ʃ/
                                   ʃ only in බංගලාදේශය, ශිශ්නය, ශුක්‍ර — the learned register
```

**The four-way control**, since the sources disagree and only the referee can arbitrate:

| ශ | ෂ | analysis | folded backbone |
|---|---|---|---:|
| s | ʃ | as shipped — held by no source | 607 |
| ʃ | ʃ | literary / prescriptive (r12a) | **604** — the worst of the four |
| s | s | colloquial (Wikipedia, the merger) | **612** — chosen |
| ʃ | s | the inconsistent opposite | 609 |

**93.5% → 94.4%, symbol accuracy 98.3% → 98.6%**, across the three commits.

**The cost, stated:** si now emits no `ʃ` at all. That is correct for a spoken-Sinhala target and would be
wrong for a literary one, and it is what the only referee this language has attests — reading the whole
language in the learned register costs eight words to buy three. The eval's standing `secondary-source gap`
(epitran `sin`) remains the thing that would close this independently rather than by majority vote.

**The methodological point.** The original note was written from a *glance at the residual list*, where the
`ʃ` divergences are visible and the `s` ones are not, because the residual list shows the engine's form
first. Reading the referee *by letter* reversed the finding. A per-class aggregate is a lead; the per-letter
tabulation is the finding — trap 2, in the phonology rather than the corpus.
