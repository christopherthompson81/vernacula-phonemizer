/**
 * THE CURATED LAYER MUST NOT SILENTLY DIVERGE FROM THE OOV PATH.
 *
 * ⚠ `data/languages/english/g2p-model.json` is trained on UPSTREAM CMUdict, and `--emit` regenerates
 * `g2p-dict.tsv` from CMUdict too — so the ~20 hand corrections in `g2p-curated.tsv` reach the listed word
 * and, unless something propagates them, nothing else. Where they do not, the engine answers one way for a
 * recorded word and another for an unrecorded one IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT, which is the defect
 * `tools/english/en_rebuild_lexicon.mts` exists to prevent on the lexicon side (#1295).
 *
 * ⚠ CURATION DOES PROPAGATE THROUGH MORPHOLOGY — `morphDecode` looks its stem up in the SHIPPED dict, not
 * in the model — so most curated rows are reproduced by the OOV path for free. This test pins WHICH ones
 * are not, so the list can only shrink by decision and never grow by accident.
