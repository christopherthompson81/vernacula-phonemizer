/**
 * The dependency-free Khmer boundary perceptron — the properties a SYNC caller can rely on.
 *
 * This model exists because the BiLSTM needs `onnxruntime-node` (optional) and so can only serve the async tier.
 * The perceptron is a Map of 42,643 weights and an addition loop, so it could serve `phonemize` itself. What is
 * asserted here is deliberately structural: the model is ~77% on exact boundary placement, so pinning individual
 * splits would pin noise. See km-segmenter.PROVENANCE.md for the three-way comparison.
