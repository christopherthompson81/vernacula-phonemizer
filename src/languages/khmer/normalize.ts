/**
 * Khmer text normalization (#585) — symbols and marks the tokenizer cannot see, rewritten as Khmer words.
 *
 * WHY THESE DEFECTS EXIST, mechanically. `khmer.ts` tokenizes with
 * `TOKEN = /([ក-៓ៜ-៝]+)|([\d០-៩]+)|([។៕?!,.៖])/gu`, which is a deliberately minimal three-way split: a Khmer
 * run, a digit run, a clause mark. Everything else matches NO group and is therefore skipped in silence —
 * `%`, `$`, `°`, `&`, `+`, `/`, an en dash, and the iteration mark ៗ, whose code point U+17D7 falls in the gap
 * between `៓` (U+17D3) and `ៜ` (U+17DC). And two characters that DO match are in the wrong group: `,` and `.`
 * are clause punctuation, so a grouped number and a decimal are read as sentences with pauses in them.
 *
 * WHAT THE MINED CORPUS CONTAINS (112,905 segments; #585's artifact, no FLEURS corpus exists for Khmer):
 *   ៗ iteration        15,952 in the artifact · 24,413 in the full corpus  ← the largest single defect
 *   digit-run          27,223   year 26,030   ← both read CORRECTLY already; native digits are handled
 *   decimals            4,018   ranges 4,014   grouped 2,788
 *   percent             1,291   ampersand 1,331   arithmetic 864   fractions 326   degrees 160   currency 154
 *
 * ⚠ NATIVE DIGITS ARE 74% OF THE CORPUS — 390,251 Khmer digits ០-៩ against 140,156 ASCII. `\d` would miss 68%
 * of the digit-runs and 71% of the years, so every pattern here matches BOTH ranges explicitly. This is the
 * ASCII trap the toolchain documents at three other levels; Khmer is where it bites hardest.
 *
 * WHAT THE ENGINE PRODUCED BEFORE, probed form by form:
 *   ថ្មីៗ         → tʰməj                    the reduplication silently DROPPED
 *   ១,០០០,០០០     → muəj , soun , soun       "one, zero, zero" — the grouping comma is a CLAUSE PAUSE
 *   ៣.៥ គីឡូ      → ɓəj . pram kiːlou        decimal point read as a phrase break, splitting the number
 *   ៩៨%           → kawsəp pramɓəj           the % vanished
 *   ១៩៩០–២០០០     → … kawsəp piː poən        two numbers, nothing between them
 *   ៣៥°C          → saːmsəp pram sˈiː        ° vanished; C fell through to the English letter name
 *   $១០០          → muəj rɔːj                the sign vanished
 *   ១/៤           → muəj ɓuən                "one four"
 *
 * ── SOURCING. Every word below is corpus-attested with the SENSE checked, per the Fula lesson. Counts are
 * from the full mined corpus:
 *   ភាគរយ   percent   445, and 230 of those directly after a digit — so it is POSTPOSED
 *   ដុល្លារ dollar    712
 *   អង្សា   degree     74 after a digit · អង្សាសេ "degrees Celsius" 25 after a digit
 *   ដល់     to (range) very frequent; 81 phrase hits in the artifact alone
 *   និង     and        40,204 — the single commonest word in the language
 *   បូក     plus       corpus-attested, 6 phrase hits in the artifact
 *   ភាគ     part       `៥ភាគ៦` = 5/6 attested 74 times, so the fraction frame is NUM ភាគ NUM
 *
 * ⚠ THE DECIMAL POINT HAS NO SOURCEABLE READING, and the near-miss is worth recording. `sources.ts` reports
 * `[NONE] decimal-point`. Two candidates were probed against the full corpus and both LOOKED available —
 * ចុច ×157, ក្បៀស ×18 — and both fail on sense: neither occurs between digits even once, and ចុច's
 * collocations are `ដោយចុច` "by clicking", `ក្តារចុច` "keyboard", `ទៅចុចចំបេះដូង` "press on the heart". It is
 * the verb "to press". So the documented fallback applies: read the fraction digit-by-digit with no separator
 * word, which here means removing the point so the digits are not split by a clause pause.
 *
 * ⚠ AND NO CLOCK RULE, deliberately. The corpus writes the frame word ITSELF — `ម៉ោង ៨:៣០` (76 instances),
 * `ម៉ោង ១១:០០ នាទីព្រឹក` (29) — so inserting ម៉ោង would duplicate what the writer already typed, which is the
 * Arabic الساعة defect the playbook records. ASCII `:` is not in `clausePunctuation`, so it is dropped without
 * a pause and the two numbers read adjacently, which is defensible. Left alone on purpose.

 * THE SHARED SYMBOL TIER, not local regexes — playbook trap 16: before declaring a class out of scope, check
 * whether the seam already exists. It did, for five of the classes this file first solved by hand, and it
 * carries two Khmer needs that hand-written rules had missed entirely.
 *
 * `unspacedScript` is the load-bearing flag, and the tier's own header documents Khmer's exact symptoms against
 * Chinese: the boundary guards assume spaces between words, so in an unspaced script the ORDINARY case is the one
 * they reject — `20°C` read its C as English *sˈiː*, and `km²` dropped the `²`. Khmer separates words with
 * U+200B rather than a space, so it belongs in the same class as cmn and yue.
 *
 * Sourcing, all corpus-attested with the sense checked against digit or unit adjacency:
 *   percent      ភាគរយ    445, of which 230 directly after a digit
 *   currency     ដុល្លារ  712
 *   °C / °       អង្សាសេ 25 after a digit · អង្សា 74 — declared as UNITS, which is how the tier reads a scale
 *   exponent     ការេ     ⚠ THIS WAS WRONGLY REFUSED FIRST TIME. It is 0/0 DIGIT-adjacent, and I concluded from
 *                         that it was unsourceable — but `²` attaches to a UNIT, not a digit, and ការេ is
 *                         exactly the square-metre word: ម៉ែត្រការេ ×17, គីឡូម៉ែត្រការេ ×10, ម៉ែតការេ ×20.
 *                         `position: "compound"` because it FUSES, like Swedish kvadratkilometer.

    // key cannot reach it because the tier refuses a sign preceded by a Latin letter, which is the guard that
    // stops a sign being read out of the middle of a Latin word; a multi-character key is matched as a unit and
    // sidesteps it. ដុល្លារអាមេរិក is attested ×116.
