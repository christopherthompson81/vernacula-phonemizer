     *   UNTONED spelling was probed as its own word and carries the finding: `milimita` is 12 tokens / 9
     *   articles, every readable hit rainfall or a botanical measurement — *"1189.7 milimita gbogbo òjò"*,
     *   *"òjò tí ó ju milimita 150 (5.9 in) lọ"*, *"10 nípasẹ 10 milimita"*, *"àwọn milimita 61.59 ti
     *   ojoriro"*. Same word, tone marks written or not, which is this corpus's normal condition; the
     *   TONED form is emitted because every other unit noun in this file is toned and the g2p reads it.
     * · `l` → *lítà*, 10 tokens / 5 articles, senses read and all volume: *"tó lítà 298 (ẹsẹ̀ onígun mẹ́ta
     *   10.5)"* (a car's boot), *"ẹ̀rọ Ford OHC lítà 2.0"*, *"Jala Porimala Jojona (35,000 lítà)"*, *"lítà
     *   omi bílíọ̀nù 61.7 lójoojúmọ́"*, and a Wikipedia style note that glosses the English outright:
     *   *"wọ́n lè kọ \"one litre\" (LÍTÀ KAN)"*. `líta` is ×0; `lita` ×9 is mostly the footballer Leroy
     *   Lita and a Ford engine displacement, which is why the toned form is the one taken.
     *
     * ⚠ THE ONE-LETTER KEY `l` IS SAFE HERE, AND THE MEASUREMENT IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE RAW COUNT
     * SAYS (trap 46). A bare grep for a digit then `l` finds THIRTEEN hits in the mined artifact and not
     * one is a litre: every one is Yoruba's proclitic `l-` glued to the next word after a number —
     * `1975 lẹ́yìn`, `1829 látàrí`, `2.8 làti`, `30,000 lábẹ́`, `2015 lọ`, `1985 lóri`, `2012 láti`. That
     * is exactly the shape that bit `mad`, `rn` and `hmn` this session. What saves it is that the tier's
     * trailing guard is `(?![\p{L}\p{M}'’ʼ])` and a Yoruba letter follows the `l` in all thirteen: rebuilt
     * with the guard, the count is 0 matches, so declaring `l` claims nothing the corpus would refuse.
     * ⚠ `L` IS DECLARED ALONGSIDE `l` — the litre's documented exception to the one-letter rule
     * (`resolveUnitSymbol`): both cases are official for this unit and the exact branch is case-sensitive.
     *
     * ⚠ POSTPOSED, AND THE MIXED COUNT RESOLVES ON A READING. Over the mined artifact the unit noun follows
     * its number 4 times and precedes it 6, which looks like the `hil`/`rw` question — but the six are all
     * ATHLETICS EVENT NAMES (`mita 5000`, `mita 3000`, `kilomita 10`, "the 5000 metres"), an idiom naming a
     * race rather than measuring anything, while every genuine MEASUREMENT is digit-first: `4,180 kìlómítà
     * (2,600 miles)`, `500 mítà (1,600 ẹsẹ̀ bàtà)`, `8.62 mítà (28.3 ft)`, `10,000 mita`. 4:0 once the
     * event names are set aside, so the tier's default order stands and no `unitPrefix` is declared.

/**
 * THE BARE METRE, CLAIMED LOCALLY RATHER THAN IN THE TIER — and the reason is one measured counter-example
 * class that a `units` entry has no way to decline.
 *
 * The word is not in doubt. *mítà* is 69 tokens / 20 articles on yo.wikipedia and its metre article is
 * definitional — *"Mítà je eyo tìpìlẹ̀ ìwọ̀n ìgùn ninu Sistemu Kakiriaye fun awon Eyo (SI)"*, "the metre is
 * the base unit of length in the International System of Units" — with running text to match: *"òkè òkúta
 * iyanrìn tó ga tó 500 MÍTÀ (1,600 ẹsẹ̀ bàtà)"*, *"omi náà dé ibi gíga jùlọ ní 8.62 MÍTÀ (28.3 ft)"*. It is
 * also the stem this file already ships inside `kìlómítà` and `mílímítà`.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IS IN DOUBT IS THE ONE-LETTER KEY, and unlike `l` above the measurement here is NOT clean. Rebuilt
 * with the tier's own digit-adjacent guard over the mined artifact, `m` matches THREE times:
 *     `2419 m (7936 ft)`   — Chappal Waddi's elevation. A genuine metre.
 *     `9h 50m 30.0s`       — MINUTES. Jupiter's rotation period.
 *     `9h 55m 40.6s`       — MINUTES. The same article, the System III period.
 * One right against two wrong is not a key this file may hand to the tier: `50 mítà` for fifty minutes is
 * confidently wrong, which is worse than the raw letter it replaces. But refusing outright leaves every
 * Yoruba metre unread, and the brief's standing rule is that a thin corpus is evidence about the corpus.
 *
 * So the metre is read HERE, with a left guard that declines exactly the losing shape: a digit, an `h`, and
 * a space immediately before the number is the `Nh Nm Ns` astronomical/duration notation, and nothing else
 * in this corpus writes it. 1 of 1 genuine claimed, 2 of 2 counter-examples declined.
 * ⚠ AND NOTHING IS LOST BY KEEPING IT OUT OF THE TIER, measured rather than assumed: the tier would add a
 * rate and an exponent path, and this corpus has `m/s` ×0 and a bare `m²` ×0 (all 24 of its `m`-superscripts
 * are `km²`, which `UNIT_SQUARED` and the tier already read).
 * ⚠ POSTPOSED, like every other unit here — see the units note above for why the corpus's preposed
 * instances are athletics event names rather than measurements.
