/**
 * Burmese (my) cardinal number → words.
 *
 * Burmese has a DISTINCT word for every power of ten from 10¹ to 10⁷ — ဆယ် 10, ရာ 100, ထောင် 1000,
 * သောင်း 10⁴, သိန်း 10⁵, သန်း 10⁶, ကုဋေ 10⁷ — so a number is read place by place as
 * `multiplier + place`, with no myriad grouping below 10⁷. Above 10⁷ the places repeat in increments of
 * 10⁷, which this composes recursively (10⁹ = တစ်ရာ ကုဋေ, "a hundred crore").
 *
 * Two rules the sources state explicitly, both implemented:
 *  1. A place word takes its CREAKY form when a nonzero remainder follows it, and its plain form when the
 *     number ends there: ဆယ် → ဆယ့်, ရာ → ရာ့, ထောင် → ထောင့်. Wikipedia: "shift from ဆယ် (low tone) to
 *     ဆယ့် (creaky tone), except in numbers divisible by ten", and the same for ထောင်/ထောင့် at 1000.
 *  2. The multiplier တစ် (one) IS spoken before ရာ and above (တစ်ရာ = 100, တစ်ထောင် = 1000) but is
 *     omitted at ဆယ်: "Ten to nineteen are almost always expressed without including တစ် (one)", so
 *     10 is ဆယ် and 11 is ဆယ့်တစ်, not *တစ်ဆယ့်တစ်.
 *
 * Sources: Wikipedia "Burmese numerals" (the place inventory, the increment rule, and both quoted tone
 * rules); Omniglot "Numbers in Burmese" (the 0–10 and tens lists, cross-checked). Every numeral word was
 * verified to phonemize through this engine standalone before being used here.
 *
 * ENGINE LIMITATION, not a data one: Burmese compound voicing sandhi is deferred in burmese.ts (see its
 * header), so a place word after a multiplier stays voiceless where a speaker voices it — 90 ကိုးဆယ်
 * renders [ko˥˩sʰɛ˨] where Omniglot romanizes "koe-zeh". The orthography here is correct; the voicing is
 * the engine's known gap.

/**
 * Non-negative integer → the Burmese numeral as ONE orthographic word (no spaces). Burmese writes
 * numerals solid — တစ်ရာ, တစ်ထောင့်တစ်ရာ့ဆယ့်တစ် — and joining them here rather than emitting separate
 * tokens is what lets the engine segmenter and compound voicing apply across the joins: 100 renders
 * [təja˨] as a speaker says it, not [tɪʔ ja˨] as two isolated words.
