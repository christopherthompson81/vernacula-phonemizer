/**
 * Async neural entry for Hebrew (he) — the PHASE-2 path that reads everyday UNVOCALIZED Hebrew. It groups
 * consecutive bare words into CLAUSES and hands each whole clause to the neural nakdan (hebrewTagger.ts), so the
 * bidirectional pass sees CROSS-WORD context and can resolve homographs (ספר = sefer/safar/siper). A word that
 * already carries niqqud is phonemized DETERMINISTICALLY by the rule g2p instead (and would break the tagger's
 * skeleton run). Numbers/punctuation are the sync engine's; clause assembly follows the sync engine's convention.
 *
 * When `onnxruntime-node` or the model is absent the tagger is `undefined` and this returns exactly the sync
 * (rule-engine, vocalized-only) path — no throw. Separate async path; the sync engine and its tests are untouched.
 * See src/languages/hebrew/he-tagger.PROVENANCE.md.
